Below couple of bugs observed on ContctUs page

1. Invalid entry (e.g. in email field if we enter invalid string which is not email) & hit submit button throws an exception.
   It should have been handled by been handled by meaningful error message not the exception.

2. Successful submission doesn't give any success message to the user, rather it just clear the field value.
   It should show the message to acknowledge successful submission.
